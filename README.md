# downgrade-check
This small tool will check if you have downgraded your Nintendo 3DS system properly to the NATIVE_FIRM of 9.2 (2.46-0) or lower.

This uses a modified lpp-3ds by Rinnegatamante to remove unnecessary features (and so it might actually boot on a 9.2 system). The source of this mod can be found at `lpp-3ds-strip.zip`. It is identical to the one mashers-gl-updater uses.
