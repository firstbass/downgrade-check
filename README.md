This small tool will check if you have downgraded your Nintendo 3DS system properly to the NATIVE_FIRM of 10.4 (2.50-11) or lower.

This only checks the NATIVE_FIRM version. It is for checking if the DSiWare NATIVE_FIRM downgrade method for 11.0 worked correctly. Nothing else, nothing more. It's a very simple hack.

The original downgrade-check this is forked from uses a modified lpp-3ds by Rinnegatamante to remove unnecessary features (and so it might actually boot on a 9.2 system). The source of this mod can be found at `lpp-3ds-strip.zip`. It is identical to the one mashers-gl-updater uses.
